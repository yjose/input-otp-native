## Animated Stripe Style

This example demonstrates an animated version of the Stripe-style OTP input with:

- **Fade-in animations** for entered characters
- **NativeWind styling** for consistent design

> Make sure you have `react-native-reanimated` and Nativewind installed and configured in your project.

<Code
  code={animatedStripeCode}
